# Tachidesk-qtui
a c++/qt client app for use with Tachidesk server
A free and open source manga reader to read manga from a [Tachidesk-Server][tachidesk-server] instance.

Tachidesk-qtui needs to connect to an already hosted server.

You can run it on Android and any desktop platform. Android and iOS has provided binaries, the AUR has a package for arch linux, but if you want it on another platform you'll have to build it.


### Arch based Linux
Download the latest release from [the aur](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tachidesk-qtui/).

If you use yay, you can run `yay -S tachidesk-qtui` inside a terminal window.

### Android
Download the latest apk from [the releases section][release]

### iOS
Download the latest ipa from [the releases section][release]
You will need a jailbroken iOS to install it.

## General troubleshooting
### Nothing is loaded
Make sure you have set the server address in the server settings
